This repository contains the demo code for the following paper:

* Huu M. Le, Anders Eriksson, Thanh-Toan Do and Michael Milford - A Binary Opptimization Approach for Constrained K-Means Clustering - In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) 2018. Arxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10134

The current implementation uses MOSEK as Linear Programming Solver. Please obtain a free academic version of MOESEK at: https://www.mosek.com/. An implementation using CXXPY will be available in future releases.


Usage: 
To run the demo with synthetic data, execute the following command: 

`python synthetic_experiments.py`

This code was tested on an Ubuntu Machine with Python 2.7.
